Now that I have your attention, let me show you something I think about when
listening to music: Redistibuting songs among bands. If you don't get it, it
might be you need some imagination. Some of these songs are covers which are
better than the originals. Others would have been better perfomed by the
proposed artist/band. Sometimes I'm just reassigning them because that
artist/band only has so few songs I like, that I  would rather have someone
else's repertoire get so much better.
