It starts with a single post and a single
blog. I hope this is not one of those things I start and abandon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why now? Becouse in the last weeks I felt the urge to write for myself. 
Knowing my thoughts will be publicly available forces me to think wisely, 
and arrive to better conclusions. 
Aditionally, until now didn't like any of the blogging platforms out there, 
but now with pelican, being able to craft my own posts with markdown and vim
is also part of the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I do my best to get to the point. Quality over quantity.
Why write a thousand words if a picture says more than a thousand words?
Why write six paragraphs if you can fit an introduction, main idea
and conclusion in just three?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is short, &lt;a href="http://getnashty.com/write-less"&gt;write less&lt;/a&gt;, read this and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Sorry for the length of this post. I didn't have time to make it shorter.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry></feed>
