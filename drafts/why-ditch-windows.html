    <time datetime="2013-07-03T18:06:00">Wed 03 July 2013</time>    <p>I won't give reasons to you to ditch Windows, but rather my answer to 
the OS switching dilemma.</p>
<p>Mainstream OSes (OS X, windows and ubuntu) can provide a great or an awful 
experience, give you headaches and bring you satisfactions. </p>
<p>It is not what features each OS has, but what is your willingness to solve 
the problems you will likely find in your way. 
An this applies exactly for almost anything.</p>
<p>At the university, we got ubuntu in the library's PCs. A friend of mine wanted 
to open a pdf file in those and for some x reason he couldn't. He told me: 
"What!....is this linux? Linux sucks, I can't even open a pdf file!" 
I'm pretty sure his conclusions would have been different if the same experience 
had happened in his Windows 7 notebook.</p>
<p>People are not rationale when making decitions. Some people don't care if apps are open-source or not, 
they want them to just work, or sometimes they want to be on fashion becouse 
everyone is using it.</p>
<p>Even some people can live and think in three parallel dimensions, which allows 
them to love the open source philosophy, use windows and want to have a mac.</p>
<p>Let him decide. Better than giving reasons for using or not using <insert OS here>, 
I would just say: "Switch if you want, and use it on your own risk, as I did"</p>
<p>I switched to Ubuntu.</p>
