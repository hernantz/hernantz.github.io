<p>I tend to be very critic with the movies and books I consume. And, if the ideas
behind them are any good, I get hooked and start to think of ways they could be
improved.</p>
<p>Since many people tend to canalize this spark in some form of fan-fiction, I
figured, why not do the same?</p>
<p>In this case I'll review the Dark Tower book series, which I read a long time
ago. In my opinion, Stephen King's magnum opus ended up being too ambitious and
I reckon he felt this urge to finish it somehow, after the accident of course.
And, the fact that he is now sober did't help either.</p>
<p>See, not many people disagree with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] Wolves of the Calla, Song Of Susannah (UGH!) and this, The Dark Tower. They
all seem to have been written in a rush after King's brush with mortality
when he was hit by that van. What a waste of all the great material he had to
work with. If I was rating the first four books, my review would have been
five stars. Unfortunately...</p>
<p>Hated the way the vast world of the gunslinger kept getting smaller, with
constant trips back to good old New York, to dabble in real estate and
investing in Microsoft. Real friggin' epic. [...]</p>

<h2 id="my-attempt-at-fixing-everything">My attempt at fixing everything<a class="headerlink" href="#my-attempt-at-fixing-everything" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I loved the first and second books as is, they are brilliant (you can almost
feel the effect of drugs kicking in Stephen's mind). The Wastelands is where
the story starts to deteriorate. I would have never resurrected Jake and I
would forget about the whole idea of 19, The Wizzard of Oz, Ka-tet Corp, Angul
Siento, Calvin Tower, Mordred and Dixie Pig. This all could have been great
material for a sequel of Salem's Lot to find out what happend with father
Kallahan. But here it felt weird.</p>
<p>This is how I would mixed and re-organize the world of the Dark Tower, based
entirely on content from the series.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The gunslinger</strong>. First edition of course, stays almost intact. The town
   folk, rallied by the preacher woman, has beaten and raped the bartender
   girl. She begs Roland to kill her. O Discordia! she screams before getting a
   headshot. The Man in Black also mentions the reasons behind following the
   Crimson King: <em>"You think that John Farson or I are on the bad side. But
   what makes you believe you are on the right side? The Crimson King might
   have gone mad, and his ways are misterious, yes. But that is nothing to do
   with my reason to be with his cause. The problem with this whole good &amp; bad
   thing is that chaos is not evil any more then order is good. Balance between
   chaos and order is necessary. With no chaos nothing would ever change or be
   created. Without order nothing could ever thrive once it is created.
   Conflict forces change and change is how progress happens. Sometimes in
   order to create, one must first destroy. The Crimson King is starting a
   revolution, and for it to succeed, the Tower must fall!"</em></li>
<li><strong>The drawing of the three</strong>. Pretty much stays intact too. When Roland
   looses his fingers laments with O Discordia. He doesn't save Jake. The third
   member of the ka-tet is Oy.</li>
<li><strong>Wizzard and glass</strong>. We learn about Roland's youth story at Mejis. When
   the ka-tet returns from Mejis, brought the Grapefruit orb and a kid with
   them, Bill, who is now an orphan because of the gang of the Big Coffin
   Hunters killed his parents. After Gabrielle Deschain's murder, Roland and
   Jamie travel back to Serenity, where the women agree to adopt young Bill.
   The sisters that run the place also give Roland a note written by his mother
   during her stay in there. In this note, his mother reveals that Marten has
   predicted that Roland will one day kill her. Although this has caused her to
   slowly lose her sanity, in the end she forgives Roland and asks that he
   forgive her infidelity to his father and betrayal of Gilead in return.
   Roland never talks about this with his father. I think this is a good
   closure for that story.</li>
<li><strong>Wolfs of Calla</strong>. They find Calla (the far end of their known Mid-World)
   after chasing someone who was visiting the North Central Positronics Dogan.
   The Dogan becomes the standard metaphor for the internal workings of the
   brain of the ka-tet and Mia's possesion. There is a door they cannot open
   with the Crimson's King eye graffitied. They are introduced to the town
   folk, the wolfs, dance the Commalah, etc. They prepare for the battle
   trainning, with Roland's martial knowledge. The kat-tet receives Black
   Thirteen from the cult that worshiped doors, the Mannis. Eddie sees Rolands
   past in it and how he will betray them for the Tower. Rolands sees Jake
   falling, Sussanah gets possesed by Mia, a demon from the Prim that inhabited
   inside the orb, that now starts to grow in her and wants the to steal the
   orb to reach the tower and free all the monsters that inhabitate the Prim.
   We understand why Roland is how he is, and why he wants to set the Tower
   aside to help this town, to redeem himself. His determination for the tower
   is succumbing now, he feels guilty, he is not as cold-hearted as he seems.
   Jake's death would be Roland's secret to this ka-tet, and that's hunting
   him, giving him nightmares, he tells no one but Talitha, the matriach of the
   town, during the sessions where she helped him with his arthritis. She also
   makes Andy, her robotic personal assistant, fond of telling horoscopes,
   promiss that will help Roland in times of need. She dies of age, but gives
   Roland possession of her cross to lay at the Tower, Andy says O Discordia!
   at her burial. They later, after a fight realise they have been keeping
   secrets from each other, and Black Thirteen is the culprit, so the reconcile
   and share mind (like the Dogan metafor that will later be used to defeat the
   wolfs). Eddie gets knighted as a gunslinger. Sussanah becames a sister of
   Oriza, women musn't bear guns.</li>
<li><strong>The wind through the keyhole</strong>. Roland is hidding with the kids of Calla
   waiting for the worlfs. Want to hear the story of the young gunslinger who
   slayed a Werewolf? He tells the little sisters of Eluria story. Basically
   the good sister tell him <em>the wind through the keyhole</em> story one night,
   while Roland is recovering from the sickness so he could sleep. The story is
   the same but the young boy slayed a werewolf in the swamp instead of
   encountering a dragon, with the gun and silver bullet that the Covenant Man
   gives him. He is later slayed by a dragon in the same swamp when trying when
   he returns to the enchanted forest looking to save another girl. Back in
   Calla, they defeat the wolfs, many folks die, including children. They
   notice that someone has given information to the wolfs. Eddie dies in this
   fight, he was not true knights after all. His body is buried with his gun,
   and a rose is planted in his grave like a gunslinger funeral. In front of
   all the new graves, Roland gives a speech, that ends with: O Discordia! The
   Tower demanded another sacrifice, now Roland is determined to end this
   curse. Ka is a wheel, and again, for saving the day, he must pay with blood
   of his loved ones, and looses his ka-tet again. His road to the Tower is
   paved in blood.They burn the jaw of the men in black, and ask the fire a
   question and the fire shows them a vision of the traitor, who they hung. He
   wanted his daughters to survive and become the new rulers of the Callas  <em>I,
   Roland Deschain of Gilead, son of Steven, last in the line of Eld, protector
   of the Dark Tower, sentence you to die</em>. Sussanah get's finally possesed and
   tries to murder the gunslinger, in the fight manipulates Oy (again with the
   Dogan methaphor) to attack Roland, you looses an eye. Roland shoots Oy who
   dies in his hands, it's last word is <em>Tower</em>. From now on he will wear an
   eye patch and a big scar in his face. Mia escapes with the orb, but gets
   caught by And and later exorsised by the Mannis. With some remnants of magic
   and magnets they throw the demon through a portal in the Doorway Cave to the
   Todash. After that Sussanah decides to stay at Calla as a sister of Oriza,
   and maybe marries someone there to become the new matriach, since Talitha
   had no descendants.</li>
<li><strong>Wastelands</strong>. Roland returns to the North Central Positronics dogan, with
   help of Andy, they open the locked door and get a terminal to tell them
   where the beam is and they figure that it is connected with Lud. With some
   shardik's reference, we learn a bit about the myth of the guardians. That is
   where the wolfs come from. They follow it into the Outer-World to Lud with
   Black thirteen and Andy. In Lud, we enjoy all the post-apocaliptic cyberpunk
   goodness ala Mad Max or The 100, graffities of the Crimson King eye and some
   slow mutants too. We learn that gangs stole kids to give them to Dandelo, a
   minion of the Crimson King, who roont them, a monster similar to IT, if not
   IT itself. Dandelo feeds from emotions, so it is Andy the one that kills it
   by self-destructing, saving Rolands life. Roland finds that there are good
   people still in this ruined world. The kids that returned roont, were helped
   by some good folk (someone saved my life tonight?). When he kills one of
   them: <em>you didn't have to kill him, it was his birthday today, oh
   Discordia...</em>. Blain kills everyone in the city by orders of the Crimson
   King, who has gone mad and is now recluded at the top of the Tower.</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Tower</strong>. Roland beats the train with a stupid riddle Curthbert
   once told him, before the battle at Jerico hill, where we learn a bit more
   about the fate of Farson. After passing some of the worlds of other stories
   (the Tower is colapsing and all the worlds are blending), Roland is left in
   the final stop, Tower Station, the door to the Tower, the only one in
   All-World. The old ones built this station and tried everything to open that
   portal, yet never successfuly. Blaine commits suicide. Roland has Black
   Thirteen that <em>weaks up</em> and starts to absorb everything like a blackhole,
   including him. The gunslinger has this vision of the rose that holds all the
   suns and all the universes that Jake saw in NYC, and all the lovecroftian
   darkness and beings of the Prim in between worlds. Wakes up in the crimson
   fields of Can'-Ka No Rey.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-alternative-ending">My alternative ending<a class="headerlink" href="#my-alternative-ending" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>And this is how I imagine the final encounter. Once Roland reaches the Dark
Tower. I put special atention to the opening line.</p>
<p><em>Alone he was when he started his journey, and alone is how Roland reaches the
Dark Tower.</em></p>
<p>The Tower is the aphoteosis of all towers. Black of course. The stones have
cracks, and in between each huge stone he notices something dense fluid. Blood
of course. The Tower is bleading, and that blood feeds the surrounding fields
of roses through its roots. The Tower is alive, but in agony.</p>
<p>The entrance is a huge ghostwood door and depicts all the twelve guardians of
the beam engraved on it.</p>
<p>Roland knows what to do. Leaves Talitha's cross in the floor and blows
Cuthbert's horn to open it. And it opens, of course.</p>
<p>The inside is void. There are no windows and no decorations on the walls. Only
spiraling steps. A hundred? Or a thouthand maybe? He begins to climb.</p>
<p>After a while, he is halfway to the top and takes some time to recover, then,
more steps. His hands touch something on the wall, some sort of pattern. He
realizes there are murals carved on them. Murals that tell the origin of it
all, the legend of Eld, he keeps going, the fall of Gilead, more steps.</p>
<p>To his surprise, the murals now tell his life, Alain and Cuthbert, the battle
of Jerico hill, the girl at the window â€” his true and only love Susan.</p>
<p>His heart halts abruptly. Eluria, the Mohaine desert, Jake, the man in black.
He shivers. Talitha, Eddie, Sussanah, Oy. It's too much. Tears start to fall.</p>
<p>Boys don't cry maggot! Hears Cort shout him in his mind, yet it echoes all over
the tower.</p>
<p>The doors by the beach, Calla, Lud, Blaine. More steps.</p>
<p>It feels it's been a lifetime climbing. This thought clicked in his mind in a
weird way. Finally, he reaches the top.</p>
<p>There is a strange typing machine on a desk, with some sort of writing in low
speech. He reads: <em>Alone he was when he started his journey, and alone is how
Roland reaches the Dark Tower.</em> â€” it makes no sense to him.</p>
<p>There is one last door. A red one, with an Eye painted in blood. The eye of the
Crimson King. He opens it and he is finally at the rooftop.</p>
<p>The sunset has started. He sees the never ending sea of roses laying under the
infinite shade casted by the Tower.</p>
<p>The Crimson King, in a human shape, is seated next to pile of black rocks he is
stacking in what seems an imposible balance.</p>
<p>Childe Roland to the dark tower came! Long days and pleasant nights, sai â€” he
says.</p>
<p>Roland, not sure what how to respond, says nothing.</p>
<p>You must be exhausted from your journey. So am I.</p>
<p>What do you mean? Asked Roland.</p>
<p>Take a seat Roland, it's about time we talked.</p>
<p>Since I've thought about this moment carefully, you deserve it, I thought it
would be best to write it down. Says the man as he unfolds a piece of paper, a
letter. And begins to read out loud.</p>
<p>Dear Roland.</p>
<p>I know what you want to hear, what you came here for.</p>
<p>You are looking for answers. But I'll give you something better instead.
Redemption. Because when we think we have all the answers, the questions
change.</p>
<p>You are not a bad person, nor a good one. Most importantly, you have not
forgotten the face of your father. In this level of the tower, I get to judge
that. But you did well, better than I expected, And yes, it was worth it, all
the blood and tears. Your loved ones left behind, their names in your head
right now, and everything your ever cared. All this sacrifice, your existance,
was used to construct this tower. Every door you have opened in your life, has
been inside this place. It will withstand the eons of time, and your story will
prevail in it's murals, and in other worlds, Roland.</p>
<p>The Crimson king takes a moment and continues.</p>
<p>This Tower is also my prison. I've been trying to end it all my life. It's been
my obsession, a heavyweight burden, and one of my most ambitious projects. The
pieces of the puzzle that must fit, to balance the forces all together, to keep
you alive. I've tried to stop you, time and time again, but you stayed on track
in your crusade. I made you that way, Roland.</p>
<p>One grows fond of every character and story that tells, each takes a peace,
they feed from you, they become alive! Creating an universe, watching it grow
and most importantly, keeping it alive, is an exhausting task. I'm afraid of
never be able to finish it.</p>
<p>Would I risk destroying your world as well as the other worlds I have touched
my imagination, and drawn from? Would you risk it all?</p>
<p>We all have our tower, our epic quest. You are part of mine, gunslinger.</p>
<p>We know it demands a lot of sacrifice, it might even mean our end, yet it is
our duty to keep going on, for that we are destined to find it and climb it's
steps.</p>
<p>All roads are different, because all towers are different. My road to the Tower
is paved in ink. It might be something that only matters to us, but in the
grand scheme we are nothing but dust. We have to do it. That is our redemption
and we pay the price. </p>
<p>And where is the Tower of all towers? What would the nature of such tower be?
Who will wait for us atop? Will anyone be there? No one knows.</p>
<p>The Crimson King looks at Roland, folds the letter again and then observes the
constelations sprawling above. Roland does the same. All twelve guardians are
there, shinnig brightly, perfectly aligned around the tower. The sword of Eld
could easyly be appreciated in all it's splendor too.</p>
<p>Who are you? Asked Roland.</p>
<p>I have many names, the Crimson King is one of them, it is how I'm known here.
But my real name is Stephen, Stephen King, see the pun? I'm a writer. As such I
get to create universes, casts light and shadows in them, and force others to
do my bidding as I work behind the scenes, behind the curtain, in my writings
â€” and gestures with his fingers as if typing in the air.</p>
<p>It's all in my mind, hunting me until I write it into existance. You, this
tower, everything... </p>
<p>But if I have to be honest, it is not trully me that created them, you know. To
peek in Ganâ€™s novel does not make one Gan, although many creative people seem
to think so. No writer is Gan â€” no painter, no sculptor, no maker of music. We
are kas-ka Gan. The prophets of Gan. Each prophet has a style. Mine is to put
characters in dificult situations they have to overcome.</p>
<p>I'm afraid all of this could fall apart at anytime. You don't get an idea how
close I've been to death, and with that, the end of this all. O Discordia! â€” the
Crimson King laments.</p>
<p>â€” The gunslinger, plain as he is, doesn't like this talking. Shivers run through
his spine. </p>
<p>I am your maker, Roland. Consider yourself lucky, how many get that chance? I
hadn't, yet... I hope. I know there's someone greater than me. There always is.
Remember gunslinger, the greatest mystery the Universe offers is not life but
size. Size encompasses life, and the Tower encompasses size.</p>
<p>Bullshit, you are a charlatan, that's what you are.
This can't be fiction. Look I'm real, my life is real, this tower is real!</p>
<p>The Crimson King shrugs.</p>
<p>Enough of this! I want to hear no more. First comes smiles, then lies. Last
comes gunfire - said Roland. I'll shoot you! - added.</p>
<p>The Crimson King nodded, accepting the deal.</p>
<p>Tonight redemption and death are tied together. Death, gunslinger, yet not for
you.</p>
<p>I will move on for sure, I'm mortal after all, you will soon find out. It is in
your destinity to kill me. Do what you have to do. It will put your mind at
ease.</p>
<p>See, I need you as much as you need me. We are both our nemesis and our
redeemers. All things must come to an end, and this one story, your story is
no exception. It's time we say our goodbyes, Roland.</p>
<p>What will happen after?</p>
<p>I'll let you be. And you will walk through that door behind you. Where it leads
it won't matter to me anymore, another tower perhaps! Ka is a wheel. It
manifest as a cycle but it is spiraling in nature. One does not swim in the
same river twice. We get to the same situations in our journeys again and
again, but with new perspectives, we are not the same person we were one second
ago and you won't be the same person the next tower to reach.</p>
<p>I though THIS was the Tower!</p>
<p>This is YOUR Tower. You had to be here, gunslinger, it was your inevitable
destiny. It was very important for me that you did it. I say thankya. I know
you are a bit overwelmed now. Belive me, this is not any easier for me either.
I don't know how much could I bear if I were you. What universal truths would I
have to swallow once I get to my Tower... I try not to think... It might be...
mmm... unwise.</p>
<p>Both stare at the lamp in silence for what seemed a very long time.</p>
<p>The Crimson King knows it has been enough. They both know it has been enough.</p>
<p>So.. I'm ready whenever you are ready â€” said King.</p>
<p>Death is nothing but another door, it's time I cross it.</p>
<p>Roland still unsure what to make out of this encounter, he still confused. But
he will deliver, so he stand up, draws his heavy, ancient and deadly pistols.</p>
<p>King looks at them, takes a moment and adds with a smirk â€” go then, there are
other worlds than these.</p>
<p>Roland nods.</p>
<p>He shoots the Crimson King dead as the first rays of dawn appear in the
horizon. The creature that claimed to be his creator trips and falls down.
With his red robe, that contrast with the pitch black color of the Tower,
making it seem as if he was ablaze while falling.</p>
<p>As now he stares at the sunrise for a while, it is beautiful. He then closes
his eyes as he speaks up the names of all his friends and deaths ones. He never
gets to notice, but new roses appear in the field for every name. After all,
every rose that surrounds the Tower belongs to someone whose name has been
spoken inside, in another story, in another universe perhaps.</p>
<p>Something catches his atention.</p>
<p>While going down, he notices that the cracks in the walls are sealed. The Tower
seems to be healing. That's good â€” he thinks.</p>
<p>Once at base, he observes the Crimson King is nothing but bones now.</p>
<p>Is this a trick or are you truly dead? How many lies did you tell me? â€” says
Roland at the horrible sight.</p>
<p>He can now see that, that something was a door. A sandalwood door with a name
in high speech on it's top.</p>
<p><em>Roland</em>.</p>
<p>This is the end of his world. He has other place to go and no one is waiting
for him.</p>
<p>As soon as he enters through the door and shuts it, and a new rose suddendly
replaces it.</p>
<p>Hope you like this ending better. As you can see it is heavily insipired by the
encounter with the man in black, which I think was breathtaking. The Crimson
King falling from the Tower is also a very memorable image. Maybe this series</p>
<p>I think this idea of meta-fiction was really interesting, but I didn't like how
King did it in the series. He fits the perfect final villain of all universes.
The only worthy enemy.
With this twist in the story I have remarked the main ideas that are present
throughout all the books:</p>
<ul>
<li>The O Discordia! phrase, that King said he heard in a dream.</li>
<li>There are other worlds than these, many doors that lead to them, and death is
  one.</li>
<li>How Ka is a wheel. It is cyclyc but also moves.</li>
<li>Size is the greatest mystery the Universe offers.</li>
<li>And all this, entangled with the meaning of the Tower.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vast universe created by King is all his novels together, not just The Dark
Tower, and this way he would accomplish his dream of creating something vast
and complex as Tokien did.</p>
