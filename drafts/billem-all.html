<p>This post is thougth experiment to design a billing system, trying to be generic
enough, so that hopefully it covers a wide range of situations (if not all of
them), in which transactions that involve money take place.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A billing system is part of the lifecycle of every organization.
It is complex in nature and overlaps with other systems.</p>
<p>For instance, the <strong>accounting system</strong>, whose goal is to provide
information about the assets and liabilities an organization has.</p>
<p>It has also responsabilities about <strong>permissions</strong>, because depending on
your contract or credit balance you can access or not certain features.</p>
<p>It can be used as a <strong>metrics tracking</strong> system since certain
actions that clients perform may have an economic impact on your
app (ie: tickets sold in a cinema, are also a metric for how many people
watched the movie). It might also overlap with a stocks system, since each
purchase or refund has to be accounted as a monetary and material transaction.</p>
<p>Getting paid is a whole topic on it's own, you can issue single invoice
but get paid in several instalments for example. These systems are known as
<strong>payment gateways</strong>, an need to interact with the billing system too.</p>
<p>And finally it also has to articulate with certain <strong>CRM</strong> aspects,
as we need to record our interactions with clients and their billing information
to offer discounts, remind them of an contract expiration date, facilitate
nurturing, etc.</p>
<p>These systems exist in every organization that handles money,
but sometimes they turn invisible in the sense that they are embbeded in
another system that does something similar, an Excel spreadsheet most likely.</p>
<p>Naturally each of these different systems is a complex beast on it's own and is
better off implemented separatelly.</p>
<p>Take for example the accounting system. There are legal regulations that
dictate how this is done, and they change from country to country.
Some financial transactions have to be approved by regulatory authorities.
The granularity level managed by the accounting system also differs, since
usually you only care about the totals, so maybe exporting aggregates obtained
by the billing or stocks system is enough.
Also in the case of the permissions systems, there are other considerations
taken into account, like credentials, user roles, locks, etc.
And finally payment gateways have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard" title="PCI copliance">very strict security requirements</a> that
are better off delegated to a trusted third party system.</p>
<p>Because billing systems are also very tightly coupled with business rules,
it's really hard to build a generic catch-all solution, making it difficult to
attempt a proper sepparation of <a href="http://www.machinalis.com/blog/separating-mechanism-from-policy/" title="Separating mechanism from policy">mechanism and policy</a>. It's also evident
that the boundaries of these systems aren't so clear in terms of
responsabilities, but this doesn't mean that a common underling architecture
cannot be identified.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>From a 30k feet view, a billing system must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine what his billing status is: <strong><em>who</em></strong> owes <strong><em>how much</em></strong> and
  <strong><em>why</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Articulate with other specialized systems (ie: be able to query and be
  queried, import/export data).</li>
<li>Be flexible and fault tolerant. Flexible not only to <strong><em>adapt to ever changing
  business rules</em></strong>, but also users should have the chance to change their
  contracts, receive refunds, benefit from a discount or even a free-trial, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>But first we must take a step back so that we can identify which are the sources
of profit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong>: the simplest one, no profits though.</li>
<li><strong>Single sales</strong>: when you purchase an item or service like train tickets or
  house cleaning.</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: cable tv, hotels, insurance, fixed term deposits.</li>
<li><strong>Usage-based</strong>: like power supply or phone calls.</li>
<li><strong>A combination</strong> of all these.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these sources of profit have to be translated to money somehow.
For this to happen, we need to <strong>determine when to record that something has
generated some profit</strong> that needs to be "collected".</p>
<p>In the case of single sales it's simple to identify that moment, since it's
usually when the buy order is submitted or when the user takes hands on the
product. But how do we determine how much someone owes in case of subscriptions
or usage-based models?</p>
<p>Buying and selling items is an <em>atomic</em> operation per se, but transactions which
are always <em>on-going</em> aren't and we have to make them atomic somehow. Non-atomic
operations need a recurring tick that will meassure or sample some quantity
and/or a rate, in order to determine the value of the transaction. Every
meassurement taken can be understood as a transaction that resulted in some
profit.</p>
<p>The other determination that needs to be taken is <strong>when to charge the
customer</strong>, and for that it's up to the business owner to say if to use a
<strong>pre-bill model</strong> (like when renting a house) or <strong>post-bill model</strong> (like the
telephone bill).</p>
<h2 id="billing-entities">Billing entities<a class="headerlink" href="#billing-entities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To acomplish the goals of a billing system we need some basic building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account: holds data about contracts, pricing plans, billing details, etc.</li>
<li>Event: contains an atomic transaction and all it's context</li>
<li>Journal: events are stored in an append-only journal. It contains all the billing history of an account. Can be used for an audit.</li>
<li>Clock: it's in charge of quering the journal to determine totals, debts, which accounts are past-due, etc.</li>
<li>Processor: The journal can be digested by procressors that can understand
  the deltas between each event to determine the current status
  of an account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handling-changes">Handling changes<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-changes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>TODO: explain here flexible and fault tolerant.</p>
<p>Every change is represented by an event. An event should never be mutated.
Events should freeze all context needed to fully understand them.</p>
<p>Ability to schedule changes to take effect in the future. Example:
apply this new plan next month.
When applying changes (and even when scheduling them?), the system
should look for conflicts in all transactions, including the ones
that had not taken place yet.</p>
<p>Payments should refer to the respective source invoice(s) = [1,2,3].</p>
<h2 id="real-world-examples">Real world examples<a class="headerlink" href="#real-world-examples" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>So far I hope is clear what a billing system must do and what it needs to do it.
But we still haven't tested our theory we real world examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>EPEC</li>
<li>Hotel
And these can be combined (rent a room in a hotel, and cosume
some snack from the mini-fridge).</li>
<li>ISP</li>
<li>Ad based website</li>
<li>Sass app (trials, discounts, etc)</li>
