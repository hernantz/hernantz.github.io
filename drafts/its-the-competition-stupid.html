<h2 id="justice-for-all">Justice for all<a class="headerlink" href="#justice-for-all" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>First we need to understand something about the nature of our existence.</p>
<p>We live and die in a universe where many things are defined in a way we do not understand
nor control and can change for that matter.
The flow of time, the laws of physics, the birth and death of stars, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29" title="Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything">fundamental answer</a>.</p>
<p>Because of that, we are not 100% free. We are conditioned, limited and biased by
what we know and don't know, by what we can and cannot do, by what we perceive
and feel, by what we believe.</p>
<p>As John Hick once stated, God allows suffering, by creating us "imperfect and immature", so
that humanity might grow and develop towards a genuine understanding and perception of the Creation.
This could only be accomplished with free will, since otherwise, if we were either perfect or we had
only one choice, our existence wouldn't be of much value.</p>
<p>The decisions we make are based on partial ideas a reality we interpreted
according to our limited vision of the facts. You can imagine that there is no
perfect decision, we do what we can. We can point to an idea of "doing the best
according to the circumstances we live in", but in these circumstances, we are
responsible for our future, and some of that future depends on the quality of
decisions we make.</p>
<p>No hubo justicia para los dinosaurios. Aun cuando hubiesen hecho las cosas bien y estuviesen
muy adaptados a traves de miles de anios de evolucion a su medio, no pudieron 
sobrevivir a la caida de un metiorito (algo que no ocurre muy frecuentemente, y era imposible
de anticipar por sus mecanismos evolutivos). De nuevo, muchos factores que uno no controla.</p>
<p>No somos Dios. Nuestra existencia es fragil. No podemos aplicar justicia divina.</p>
<p>Cuando hablamos de que la justicia es un ideal inalcanzable, estoy incluyendo a la desigualdad.
Somos todos distintos, biologica y culturalmente, diferimos tambien en capacidades, valores y gustos (hay gente ciega, gente mas inteligente, etc).
Parte de aceptar la realidad y la injusticia es que no existe la igualdad de oportunidades.</p>
<p>A career open to all talents: every person should not have artificial impositions or obstacles that prevent
them from pursuing a career/goal, should they have the opportunity and capacity to do it.</p>
<p>Corollary: Success cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Now this arbitrary impositions cannot be agreed universally.</p>
<p>Impones barreras en tu empresa para que no cualquiera puede entrar, solo los que vos crees mas aptos para un puesto.
Impones barreras para limitar el accionar de violentos o psicopatas.</p>
<p>Recordemos que la meritocracia no existe, ya que no es facil asegurar que el mas apto 
termine logrando los mejores resultados, puede pasar que alguien tenga mas suerte, mas influencias,
o haya estado bajo tierra cuando cayo el metiorito.</p>
<p>Some places are hot and some are cold.
Some planets have life and some don't.
Some windows face a beautiful view to the ocean and some don't.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of opportunities: Someone should provide them.
These roles are delegated to the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing left for us is to agree on a set of artificial impositions that we are all going to live by
and that are better, to our understanding, for the kind of world we want to live in.
Ideally we have the capability to be part of that election.</p>

<p>Concepts like justice and equality are mere ideals hard to reach universally. What is fair
for some, might not be so for others. They only make sense when applied in a pragmatic way in a
given time and place.</p>
<p>Now how do get there? As it happens, in the search for justice, equality, happiness or a better life for that matter,
we come together with people alike and form organization.</p>
<p>Kinds of organizations:
<em> There are aspects that allow choices to co-exists i.e multiple newspapers, soccer teams, brands of cookies, etc.
Anyone can choose base on whatever is their motivation and possibilities.
</em> There are other things that don't allow other alternatives to co-exist. Governments are the most representative example of this kind.</p>
<p>I'm considering the government as an organization that defines rules and takes measures that are for all to obey or comply.
Centralized government is the root of all evil
Governments should be as atomic as possible.</p>
<p>Every policy that any organization imposes is an experiment basically. No one knows the future for granted.</p>

<h3 id="governments-dont-have-enough-competition">Governments don't have enough competition<a class="headerlink" href="#governments-dont-have-enough-competition" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Is difficult to change them or became a customer of a different
government. Governments make decisions that are difficult in nature (regulate how people live), which is very
dangerous if there is only one choice. See education, stupid regulations (gender on boards), clean energy.</p>
<p>Much more is achieved by lots of trial an error experiments rather than a single big plan</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An economy has untold possible outcomes. Its complexity comes both from the
near infinite variety that can come from permutations of simple rules, and
from the fact that billions of humans are playing the game simultaneously,
each affecting the outcomes for each other. Many of the rules are written down
nowhere, controlled by no one, and constantly evolving. Individuals,
businesses, and governments are all players, and none of them can know the
full consequences of their decisions.</p>

<p>Ejemplo de los containers
Should employers be required to pay men and women the same salary for the same job, there too many variables such as education, incentives or experience that determine a fair salary,
Should employers be required to have a percentage of their workforce be women or black, or employees should be hired and valued regardless of their gender or the color of their skin?</p>
<h3 id="hypocrisy">Hypocrisy<a class="headerlink" href="#hypocrisy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>People think everything is free until they have to pay for it. When the government intervenes, is doesn't have that direct impact.
If you care about something, there is for sure a way you can help, without forcing everyone else to commit as you.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-monopoly">The good monopoly<a class="headerlink" href="#the-good-monopoly" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are two primal fears in free societies:
Instead of monopolies, we should think about the things that limit competition.
- Monopolies: concentration of power in evil people.
1) Rules that protect them (bureaucracy, laws, regulations, minimum wages, etc)
2) Corruption and mafia
3) Lack of investment in technology that could provide alternatives in case of the so called "natural monopolies"
4) It works well and it's efficient</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To have progress, you want a system that is competitive, not one that is dominated by a single power.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The pursuit of universal justice and equality is futile. It can only be
approximated by certain metrics, laws, to an agreed ideal that might change over
time and is prone to subjective interpretation. There is no justice. Justice
should be provided in ways that competes with other views or understandings of
the same concept.</p>
<p>The availability of choices cannot guarantee, but increases the chances of
prosperity in a free society, in the long term and even in an unfair system, by
enabling ideas to be probed in competition with other alternatives.</p>
