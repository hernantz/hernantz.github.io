Python has virtual environments and <code>pyenv</code>.
Node has <code>nvm</code> and local <code>node_modules</code> folder.
For ruby there's <code>rbenv</code>.
And golang has goenv.</p>
<p>A package manager is a program that gets a bunch of files "packaged" in a certain format from a repository of packages and places them on a filesystem.</p>
<p>The manager part implies that it can keep track of installed packages, versions, dependencies, etc.</p>
<p>Packages are basically boxes that contain files and metadata (checksums, content types, filepaths where to place the files, etc). Some may include compiled binaries or source files for building a project and testing it, reusable libraries, debug symbols, images, icons, documentation, songs, etc.</p>
<p>Guess what, plugins are also files, so your browser has a package-manager of sorts to handle those.</p>
<p>Different programming languages ship with their own package managers to install libraries: <code>pip</code> for Python, <code>cargo</code> for Rust, <code>npm</code> for node, etc.</p>
<p>A Linux distribution is a combination of a kernel + a package manager + a process manager. A kernel and a process manager can also be installed via the package manager, since they are also binary files.</p>
<p>So all you need to create a Linux distribution is just files, an a policy to manage those files.</p>
<p>Like applications do, each distribution establishes it's own policies on packaging. How files are packaged, a release cycle, a filesystem layout where those files get unpacked, a target architecture, etc.</p>
<p>Any package manager needs at least a dependency graph solver (semver maybe), filesystem inventory tracking and an archive format to transport files (tar balls maybe).</p>
<p>We could agree that there should be only one package manager to rule them all. After all different policies simply dictate how packages are built. And some configurations could make the package manager versatile enough to resolve versioning and extract those files.</p>
<p>But the ecosystem is very fragmented. Even within the Linux community, there are many different package managers. Policy and implementation gets mixed more often than not.</p>

When we talk about versioning artifacts, we need to also talk about the strategies to do so, which depend on the type of artifact we are dealing with.
A system library (like a GUI framework) are meant to provide building blocks for other projects. If they change a piece of code, that will impact all applications that use that library.
The authors of the library need to a way to communicate breaking changes in the API.
According to the <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrums Law</a>, any change is a potential bug/contract violation. Which is right, so any project needs to read the <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/">changelog</a> and run automated integration and unit tests before updating it's dependency tree.
There are many versioning schemes, but the one that stands out is SemVer. Despite <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you">all critics</a>, it's the one that can provide semantics (duh) to each version change.
Libraries might also have to maintain several versions at the same time, and back-port features/bugfixes.</p>
<p>Security patches still need to be tested upstream for each app, to not break the system. Yes, a broken system is secure, but it is broken. The burden of shipping updates should be fall on the maintainers of each project, not on a sysadmin. There are nowadays bots that can create automatic notifications/integrations/etc and ship updates to systems that have automatic upgrades configured.</p>
<p>Apps on the other hand might not have heavy dependency with other projects, and unless they change the format of files they work with (xml for example for Excel), they can follow a pretty loose or arbitrary semver like just v1, v2, v3 or only bump a major version for more marketing impact. Apps are the root of a dependency tree.  </p>

<p>As applications have plugin manager and dependencies, distributions have packages and dependencies too.
Like software which needs to be built + released, systems can also be built (packages installed) and released (services started, db migrations run, etc).</p>
<p>Over time there has been a shift to let developers ship their apps with their
own libraries and versions. Users also enjoy having the lates features and fixes.
The problem is that since traditional package managers maintain a global state
all packages need to be curated, or users would have to embrace the dependency hell.</p>
<p>That is why containers are on the raise today.</p>
<p>They tend to solve many issues:
- Bundle your own binaries and dependencies
- Ship them as a single artifact to any distro
- To avoid duplication and save disk space, docker uses layered images. So you download ubuntu once. But many containers use different base images and you can't delete files, images only grow since they are an append only log.
- Containers also allow sandboxing, limiting cpu, memory, network and filesystem access.</p>
<p>"The downside is that the approach works best when packages are aware of the Nix approach. But the packages have not been written with Nix in mind, and some work is needed per package to adapt to the approach."</p>
<p>https://drewdevault.com/dynlib.html -&gt; sharing packages is ok, sharing libs is an overkill</p>
<p>Docker + docker-compose re implement a package distribution + process manager and orchestration + build system.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-a-manifest">The importance of a manifest<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-a-manifest" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A file where you list your dependencies, that can be parsed by automated tools (that check for updates or vulnerabilties) is paramount for auditing your computer.
This is the <code>Pakfile</code>. When you use the command line to add/remove packages, it simply updates this manifest.</p>
<p>Other systems use shells scripts or Dockerfiles which have instructions that are hard to parse automatically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, formatted plain text files can easily be manipulated by other tools.</p>
<p>In the packfile you can also override dependencies in the graph (like in pnpmjs).</p>

<p>We need a virtualenv but for system packages. Otherwise python, rust, javascript, etc re-implement the wheel over and over.</p>
<p>Reproducible builds come at the cost of more disk space, you need a lib which works fine with versions v0.[1-3], the user already installed v0.2 but you specified v0.1 in your dependencies, the user will get both copies installed (v0.1 and v0.2), even though only one was enough.</p>

<p>Qué pasa si dos librerías dependen de de una misma dependencia pero en distintas versiones, es el mismo caso que dos apps distintas dependan de distintas versiónes de una misma librería. Para esto es necesario los locks. Uno puede especificar versiones de depenencias con rangos.
Updates de seguridad implican actualizar todo? Si, sino se pierde la build reproducible. En fin: locks -&gt; build reproducible

<p>Pak manages files, it doesn't care if they are compiled binaries, pictures or source code.
So if you want to compile software for different systems, like alpine and debian, there should be two packages with different target binaries.
Since packages are identified with UUIDs, other metadata fields should specify the target architecture, just like they specify the version, the author, description, etc.</p>
<h2 id="network-vs-package-management">Network vs Package management<a class="headerlink" href="#network-vs-package-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Fetching packages from the internet should be a decoupled task from package management.
A package can be obtained from a local file, over https, a magnet link, an ipfs link, ftp, etc. Almost all of the references + auth throught tokens or passwords could be done using a URI scheme.</p>
<p>Pak should delegate this to a separate tool (is there something like a generic curl?), and only care about maintaining the local content-addressable store.</p>
<p>The bridge between these two worlds can be through a spawning a new process with CLI args for this tool to fetch the packages and put the file on a given directory. From there, pak will unpack the file and take control.</p>
<h2 id="store-paths">Store paths<a class="headerlink" href="#store-paths" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Having long paths within the store can be a problem when showing them in a traceback for instance.</p>
<p>But essentially we can use the content hash of the <code>Packfile.lock</code> manifest to create unique paths to each dependency.</p>
<p>Dependencies can be downloaded and unpacked in parallel but resolved sequentially.</p>
<h2 id="federated-repositories">Federated repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#federated-repositories" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There is the dependency confusion attack, victims think they are downloading a package named the same but with different code (because they refer to packages by name not by uuid)</p>
<h2 id="packages-uuids">Packages UUIDs<a class="headerlink" href="#packages-uuids" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Why not urls like java or go? because urls break or change.
Why not names, because they can collide across repos
UUIDS are unique across the globe that is immutable, urls and names might change.
Now you can have multiple packages named "utils" that can be private or mean distinct dependencies for different projects, or be obtained from different repositories.</p>
<h2 id="cli">CLI<a class="headerlink" href="#cli" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><code>--root</code> can change the default store directory.</p>
<p>Maybe each <code>pak add/rm &lt;package-name==version&gt;</code></p>
<p>This uses a local <code>Pakfile</code> in the pwd, other files can be used by passing the <code>--pakfile=&lt;path-to-pakfile&gt;</code> param or <code>PAKFILE</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>All packages are installed in a content-addressable store <code>/var/lib/pak/&lt;package-name-and-version&gt;/&lt;package-md5-sum&gt;/</code>.</p>
<p><code>Pakfile</code> lists dependencies and package metadata. It is better that KISS packages that have one file for each metadatum (version, sources, checksums, etc)</p>
<p>We don't need checksums for every file inside the package, this integrity should be checked with the download file checksum and signature.</p>
<p><code>package-name-version.pak.zst</code> is a tar file (zstd) with all the package content that needs to be extracted. Pak keeps track of all files. We can ask pak which package installed which file.</p>
<p><code>pak env &lt;envname&gt;</code> enters the enviroment, and sets the <code>PAKFILE</code> env to <code>/usr/share/pak/envs/envname/Pakfile</code>.</p>
<p>It also creates symlinks in the global filesystem to all the files in the store. For example <code>/bin/nginx</code> is going to be a symlink to <code>/var/lib/pak/store/&lt;package-name-and-version&gt;/&lt;package-md5-sum&gt;/nginx</code>
Another possibility is that <code>pak env</code> puts you in a shell with <code>$PATH</code> env var pointing to the different binaries in the store?</p>
<p><code>pak env --list</code> lists all available envs in <code>/usr/share/pak/envs/</code></p>
<p><code>pak --help</code> https://blog.craftyguy.net/cmdline-help/</p>
<p><code>pak run &lt;commmand&gt;</code> run the command within the environment</p>
<p><code>pak update</code> updates all versions updating also the lock file</p>
<p><code>pak update &lt;package-name==version&gt;</code> updates only the package name, updating also the lock file</p>
<p><code>pak taste &lt;package-name&gt;</code> one off shell with the package installed</p>
<p><code>pak audit</code> check for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><code>pak search &lt;package-name&gt;</code> search</p>
<p><code>pak gc</code> removes all unreachable packages from the store.</p>
<p>Hierarchy: package stores/environments/configs can be also defined in <code>~/.local/share/pak/</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Sandboxing GUI apps should be done with another binary that allows to set firewalls and also allow GUI interactions to happen via portals like in flatpak (https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap). Another example would be Opensnitch.
https://github.com/netblue30/firejail</p>
<p>Pak respects with <code>PAK_NO_COLOR</code> env or <code>--no-color</code> arg https://no-color.org/</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Pak is a runtime environment manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How the Nix user environment mechanism works. Essentially user environments are symlink trees that blend all currently installed packages into a single component so that they can be referenced from a single location. Another symlink layer manages generations of user environments. We can atomically switch between these generations by flipping symlinks. By adding the latter symlink to a user's PATH, packages can be automatically found without providing any absolute paths with hash codes in them that are difficult to remember.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides exposing packages in a user's PATH, Nix profiles are also used in NixOS to automatically find other resources, such as manual pages (through MANPATH) and KDE desktop menu items (through XDG_DATA_DIRS).
An environment is defined in a Pakfile it might list dependencies of <code>.pak</code> files that can be pinned in a Pakfile.lock</p>
<p>System directories should be mounted as RO. To avoid malicious packages from globally altering the system.</p>
<p>There are no optional dependencies or "extras", if something is optional it can be installed explicitly by the user.</p>
<h2 id="no-hooks">No hooks<a class="headerlink" href="#no-hooks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some package managers allow you to run scripts after installing a package. This should be done with oneshot scripts in systemd (like run migrations for example). There are no pre/post install scripts or hooks, these have to be commands that every package provides and a user or system needs to run.
https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2019-07-20-hooks-and-triggers/ -&gt; in order to get rid of some hooks we need to turn scripts into configuration. For example new users and password need to be a file (systemd-homed?). The man program should detect the need to re-run it's index.</p>

<p>When does dependency resolution happen? Before downloading the packages or after downloading all dependencies in parallel?
When you say <code>pak install git</code>, we go get the <code>Pakfile.lock</code> for git. There we have a graph of all dependencies that we can compare with our local <code>Pakfile.lock</code> of our profile.
If there is a sub-dependency at any point that conflicts we show an error. If there are no conflicts, we can download in parallel every sub-dependency.</p>
